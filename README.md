### Medical Dataset Analysis
This repository contains an in-depth comparative analysis of multiple machine learning algorithms for text classification tasks. The algorithms evaluated include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. The analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset of research paper abstracts and full texts related to various types of cancer.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis comprises research paper abstracts and full texts. The papers cover different types of cancer, providing a rich and diverse set of texts for classification.

## Algorithms
The following machine learning algorithms were evaluated in this study:
1.  Support Vector Machines (SVM)
2.  Random Forest
3.  Naive Bayes

## Text Preprocessing
1. Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
2. Stemming: Reducing words to their root form.
3. TF-IDF Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical form using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization.

## Evaluation Metrics
**Accuracy**
